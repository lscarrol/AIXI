# AIXI
Computable approximation of application of AIXI generalized learning


## Abstract
AIXI is an incomputable reinforcement learning variable combining Solomonoff induction with sequential decision theory. AIXI is incomputable, however a close approximation can be succesfully generated. The main focus of AIXI is creating a learning algorithm in unknown enviorments, thus abstraction is neccessary. This attempt of an application will make use of the Monte-Carlo approximation.
